Firstname Lastname Age Jill Smith 50 Eve Jackson 94 John Doe 80 An h1 header测试 2nd paragraph. Italic, bold, and monospace. Itemized listslook like: this one that one the other one Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual textcontent starts at 4-columns in. Block quotes arewritten like so. They can span multiple paragraphs,if you like. Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s allin chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis.Unicode is supported. ☺ An h2 headerHere’s a numbered list: first item second item third item Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 charactersfrom the left side). Here’s a code sample: # Let me re-iterate ... for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead ofindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like: 123define foobar() &#123; print &quot;Welcome to flavor country!&quot;;&#125; (which makes copying &amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark thedelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it: 123456import time# Quick, count to ten!for i in range(10): # (but not *too* quick) time.sleep(0.5) print(i) An h3 headerNow a nested list: First, get these ingredients: carrots celery lentils Boil some water. Dump everything in the pot and followthis algorithm: find wooden spoon uncover pot stir cover pot balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle wait 10 minutes goto first step (or shut off burner when done)Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall. Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (includingthat last line which continues item 3 above). Here’s a link to a website, to a localdoc, and to a section heading in the currentdoc. Here’s a footnote [^1]. [^1]: Some footnote text. Tables can look like this: Name Size Material Color All Business 9 leather brownRoundabout 10 hemp canvas naturalCinderella 11 glass transparent Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors. (The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supportsmulti-line tables: Keyword Text red Sunsets, apples, and other red or reddish things. green Leaves, grass, frogs and other things it’s not easy being. A horizontal rule follows. Here’s a definition list: apples : Good for making applesauce. oranges : Citrus! tomatoes : There’s no “e” in tomatoe. Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between eachterm and its definition to spread things out more.) Here’s a “line block” (note how whitespace is honored): | Line one| Line too| Line tree and images can be specified like so: Inline math equation: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Displaymath should get its own line like so: $$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$ And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characterswhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.","categories":[{"name":"学习","slug":"学习","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/categories/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/"},{"name":"经济学","slug":"学习/经济学","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/categories/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6/"}],"tags":[{"name":"CIE-AS经济学","slug":"CIE-AS经济学","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/tags/CIE-AS%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2019-11-26T16:16:05.538Z","updated":"2019-11-26T16:16:05.538Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/11/27/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/2019/11/27/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
