CIE A2 记忆: 老龄化 相关概念: developing countries, population growth, population structure Aggregate demand 总需求: Total amount of goods and services demanded in the economy at a given time and price level.

(AD=C+I+G+X-M) CIE AS 记忆: 一个经济的总需求 相关概念: aggregate supply, equilibrium (national) income Aggregate supply shock: Either an inflation shock or a shock to potential national output; adverse aggregate supply shocks of both types reduce output and can increase the rate of inflation.

Whilst this is usually seen as positive, it can also result in a negative outcome e.g. a person being willing to forego a gain / reward if it means that someone else won’t gain an even better reward. CIE A2 记忆: 看到自己关心的人过得好自己也开心 - 行为经济学的一个重要概念 相关概念: behaviour economics Allocative efficiency: Producing goods and services demanded by consumers at a price that reflect the marginal cost of supply.

Itemized listslook like: this one that one the other one Note that — not considering the asterisk — the actual textcontent starts at 4-columns in. Block quotes arewritten like so. They can span multiple paragraphs,if you like. Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., “it’s allin chapters 12–14”). Three dots … will be converted to an ellipsis.Unicode is supported. ☺ An h2 headerHere’s a numbered list: first item second item third item Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 charactersfrom the left side). Here’s a code sample: # Let me re-iterate ... for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead ofindenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like: 123define foobar() &#123; print &quot;Welcome to flavor country!&quot;;&#125; (which makes copying &amp; pasting easier). You can optionally mark thedelimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it: 123456import time# Quick, count to ten!for i in range(10): # (but not *too* quick) time.sleep(0.5) print(i) An h3 headerNow a nested list: First, get these ingredients: carrots celery lentils Boil some water.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (includingthat last line which continues item 3 above). Here’s a link to a website, to a localdoc, and to a section heading in the currentdoc.

Pandoc also supportsmulti-line tables: Keyword Text red Sunsets, apples, and other red or reddish things. green Leaves, grass, frogs and other things it’s not easy being. A horizontal rule follows. Here’s a definition list: apples : Good for making applesauce. oranges : Citrus! tomatoes : There’s no “e” in tomatoe. Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between eachterm and its definition to spread things out more.) Here’s a “line block” (note how whitespace is honored): | Line one| Line too| Line tree and images can be specified like so: Inline math equation: $\\omega = d\\phi / dt$. Displaymath should get its own line like so: $$I = \\int \\rho R^{2} dV$$ And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characterswhich you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.","categories":[{"name":"学习","slug":"学习","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/categories/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/"},{"name":"经济学","slug":"学习/经济学","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/categories/%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6/"}],"tags":[{"name":"AS经济学","slug":"AS经济学","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/tags/AS%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%AD%A6/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2019-11-26T16:16:05.538Z","updated":"2019-11-26T16:16:05.538Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/11/27/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://eduunited.org/2019/11/27/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
